In order to accept that rating frm the Product, when this UserRating is invoke from our TableViewCell, we need be able to set the rating that we want it to be represented by the star //PB ep65 16mins make this as the class of that view in main storyboard and connect this view to the TableViewCell
   
   
   var rating = 0 { //PB ep65 7mins a computed property //when this property is being set from the TableViewCell, we want to trigger the updated layout for the rating
      didSet { //PB ep65 7mins
